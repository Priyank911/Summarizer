"AI models for text summarization are designed to condense large bodies of text into their most important points. These models use advanced techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning, and Machine Learning to achieve this. Here’s a brief overview:

How It Works: Text summarization models analyze the input text and identify key sentences or phrases. They then generate a shorter version that retains the essential information. This can be done through two main approaches:","Hello, AI models for text summarization are designed to condense large bodies of text into their most important points.

"Josh Seiden and Brian Donohue discuss the topic of outcome versus output on Inside Intercom. Josh Seiden is a product consultant and author who has just released a book called Outcomes Over Output. Brian is product management director and he's looking forward to the chat.
The main premise of the book is that by defining outcomes precisely, it's possible to apply this idea of outcomes in our work. It's in contrast to a really broad and undefined definition of the word ”outcome”.
Paul, one of the design managers at Intercom, was struggling to differentiate between customer outcomes and business impact. In Lean Startup, teams focus on what they can change in their behavior to make their customers more satisfied. They focus on the business impact instead of on the customer outcomes. They have a hypothesis and they test their hypothesis with an experiment. They don't have to be 100% certain, but they need to have a hunch. There is a difference between problem-focused and outcome-focused approaches to building and prioritizing projects. For example, a company is working on improving the inbox search feature in their product. They hope it will improve user retention and improve the business impact of the change.
Product teams need to focus on the outcome of their work rather than on the business impact of their product. They need to be more aware of the customer experience and their relationship with their business.
As a business owner, you have to build a theory of how the business works. The more you know about your business as your business goes on, the more you can build a business model. The business model is reflected in roadmaps and prioritizations.
Josh's book is available on Amazon, in print, in ebook and in audiobook on Audible.com. Brian's advice for teams looking to change their way of working is to start small and to use retrospectives and improve your process as you try to implement this. Josh and Brian enjoyed their conversation.
